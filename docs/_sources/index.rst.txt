WT32SC01 Plus Driver
====================

This MicroPython driver is based on devbis' st7789py_mpy module from
https://github.com/devbis/st7789py_mpy.

I added support for display rotation, scrolling and drawing text using 8 and 16
bit wide bitmap fonts with heights that are multiples of 8.  Included are 12
bitmap fonts derived from classic pc text mode fonts.
